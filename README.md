# Project Euler Solutions

Welcome to my repository for solutions to Project Euler problems! This repository contains my solutions to the first 100 problems from Project Euler, a collection of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems. Each problem is designed to be solvable using algorithms and computational methods.

## About Project Euler

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Problems range in difficulty and cover a wide variety of topics such as number theory, combinatorics, and cryptography. The objective of Project Euler is to provide a platform for mathematical and computational exploration while also fostering problem-solving skills.

## Repository Structure

- **ProblemX**: Each folder corresponds to a specific problem from Project Euler, labeled as `ProblemX` where X is the problem number.
  - **solution.py**: Contains the Python code implementing the solution to the corresponding problem.
  - **README.md**: Includes a description of the problem, the approach used to solve it, and any additional insights.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the solutions provided in this repository. If you're attempting to solve the problems yourself, be cautious about spoilers! Reading the solutions may diminish the challenge and satisfaction of solving the problems independently. However, if you're stuck or interested in comparing solutions, feel free to examine the code and explanations provided.

## Contributing

If you have alternative solutions, optimizations, or improvements for any of the problems, contributions are welcome! Please fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

## Disclaimer

While these solutions are designed to be efficient and correct, there may be better approaches or optimizations available. Additionally, some solutions may not be the most optimal for all cases, but they serve as a demonstration of problem-solving techniques.
