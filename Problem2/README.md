# Problem Statement
The task is to find the sum of all even Fibonacci numbers below a given limit.

# Approach
## Understanding the Problem
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. In this problem, we need to find the sum of all even numbers in the Fibonacci sequence that are below a specified limit.

## Rationale behind the Solution
We can generate Fibonacci numbers iteratively and sum up the even ones until the current Fibonacci number exceeds the given limit. We iterate through Fibonacci numbers, check if they are even, and add them to the sum if they are. This approach ensures efficiency and accuracy in finding the required sum.

# Implementation Details
- The function `sum_of_even_fibonacci_below_limit(upper_limit)` calculates the sum of even Fibonacci numbers below the given upper limit.
- It takes one argument:
  - `upper_limit`: The upper limit to consider while generating Fibonacci numbers.
- The function iterates through Fibonacci numbers until the current number exceeds the upper limit.
- For each Fibonacci number, it checks if it is even and adds it to the sum if it is.
- Finally, it returns the sum of even Fibonacci numbers below the upper limit.

# Usage
To run the code, execute the `sum_of_even_fibonacci_below_limit` function in the provided Python script. The result will be printed to the console.
```bash
python solution.py
